followed by Electronic and Home Appliances.


- Average Price vs Discounted Price:

#### Price Range Focus:

The majority of products fall into the ₹251 – ₹1000 range, targeting budget-conscious customers while still maintaining a healthy review volume.


#### Correlation Between Ratings and Discounts

Categories such as Health & Personal Care and Home & Kitchen show a positive correlation between high ratings and generous discounts.

Interestingly, categories like Car & Motorbike have lower average ratings but relatively moderate discounts, indicating room for improvement in product quality or customer satisfaction.


### Notable Observations

A small number of products dominate in terms of review volume, possibly indicating top sellers or heavily promoted items.

Despite high discount rates, not all categories benefit from improved ratings—suggesting that discounting alone doesn't guarantee customer satisfaction.

The electronics category, although heavily discounted, maintains a strong presence in both revenue and review metrics.


### Strategic Recommendations

-  Product Optimization:

Focus on quality improvement in categories with low ratings despite discounts (e.g., Car & Motorbike).

- Discount Strategy:

Maintain discount strategies in electronics and computers, but explore bundling or cross-sell opportunities to boost value perception.

- Inventory and Promotion:

Prioritize stocking top-reviewed products and amplify promotions for those with high ratings and engagement.

- Customer Engagement:

Encourage reviews for newer or under-reviewed products to better understand customer sentiment and drive visibility.


## Conclusion

The Amazon Product Review Analysis dashboard provides key insights into consumer behavior, pricing efficiency, and category performance. By leveraging these findings, stakeholders can enhance product strategies, drive customer satisfaction, and increase overall profitability.
